# Currency Converter

A small React app that shows how much of USD, EUR or RUB you can get for a provided amount of BYN. 

It uses the information provided by the National Bank of Belarus' API.

**!!! There's something wrong with the API at the moment, so the app acts inconsistently. If there are no currencies, try to refresh the page a couple of times. I will try to switch for another API at some point !!!**
